README For Abstract Factory Assignment

My Abstract Factory is designed to ask the user if they would like a standard or advanced computer and then read them their information. For the sake of time the only specifications are being either advanced or standard as well as different costs. 

The Make file must be pulled out of the AbstractFactory folder in order to work properly and must call “java AbstractFactory.ComputerStore” to run.
